Hippocampi is a telehealth start-up that connects chemobrain patients with specialized medical professionals. The goal is to build an online homebase for patients and decrease wait times from 90 days (currently) to 2 weeks. As a developer, I designed the website, created the database architecture, and help build the front end (Design and Development).
